*Seek peace, and pursue it.*


I am a number theorist and have worked on a range of problems related to elliptic curves, modular forms, p-adic L-functions, and p-adic analytic geometry.  I am proudest of my work with [Peter Schneider](https://ivv5hpp.uni-muenster.de/u/pschnei2) on analytic and continuous representations of p-adic groups.

I am currently interested in bioinformatics, Bayesian statistical modelling and in mathematical questions related to genomics and phylogenetic reconstruction.

I served as Dean of UConnâ€™s [College of Liberal Arts and Sciences](http://clas.uconn.edu)  from 2008 through 2017 and as interim Provost of the University from February 2017 until April 1, 2018.

I am on leave from UConn until Fall of 2019 and am now a visiting scientist at [The Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine](http://jax.org) in Farmington, CT.
